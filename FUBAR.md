these are alot of prs

## Dearly beloved
## We are gathered here today
## To get through this thing called "life"
## Electric word, life
## It means forever and that's a mighty long time
## But I'm here to tell you there's something else
## The afterworld
## A world of never ending happiness
## You can always see the sun, day or night
## So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
## You know the one, Dr. Everything'll-Be-Alright
## Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
## Ask him how much of your mind, babe
## 'Cause in this life
## Things are much harder than in the afterworld
## In this life
## You're on your own
## And if de-elevator tries to bring you down
## Go crazy (Punch a higher floor)


This is Kyle as Alice round 2 baby!

I'm a barbie girl, in a barbie world!
